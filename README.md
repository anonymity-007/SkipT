# Highlights

> **Abstract** Prompt tuning (PT) has long been recognized as an effective and efficient paradigm for transferring large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks by learning a tiny set of context vectors. Nevertheless, in this work, we reveal that freezing the parameters of VLMs during learning the context vectors neither facilitates the transferability of pre-trained knowledge nor improves the memory and time efficiency significantly. Upon further investigation, we find that reducing both the length and width of the feature-gradient propagation flows of the full fine-tuning (FT) baseline is key to achieving effective and efficient knowledge transfer. Motivated by this, we propose Skip Tuning, a novel paradigm for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. Unlike existing PT or adapter-based methods, Skip Tuning applies Layer-wise Skipping (LSkip) and Class-wise Skipping (CSkip) upon the FT baseline without introducing extra context vectors or adapter modules. Extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of benchmarks demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our Skip Tuning over both PT and adapter-based methods.

# Data preparation

Please follow the instructions at [DATASETS.md](datasets/DATASETS.md) to prepare all datasets.

# Training and Evaluation

We provide parallel running script `parallel_runner.py` for each prompting variant including CoOp, CoCoOp, ProGrad, KgCoOp, MaPLe, PromptSRC, TCP, DePT and CoPrompt, and adapter-based variant CLIP-adapter. 

**Configure the paths in `configs.py`**

```python
base = dict(
    # dataset configs
    data = dict(
        root='your/data/root/here',
        ...
    ),

    # mail configs
    mail = dict(
        username='your@mail.com',
        password='your_mail_password_here',
        host='your.host.com',
        to='your@mail.com',
    ),

    # output configs
    output = dict(
        root='your/output/dir',
        result='your/result/acc/dir',
        cost='your/result/cost/dir',
        remove_dirs=['dirs removed before running'],
    ),
```

**Configure tasks in `config.py`**

```python
pipeline = [
    # pipelines will be run in parallel
    # Pipeline 1
    dict(
        # GPUs for this pipeline
        gpu_ids=[0, 1, 2], 
        # tasks in this pipeline will be run sequentially
        tasks=[
            'coop',
            'ft_clip',
            'skip_tuning',
        ]
    ),
    # Pipeline 2
    dict(
        gpu_ids=[3, 4, 5],
        tasks=[
            'skip_tuning',
        ]
    )
]
```

After running, the output will be in `your/output/dir`, results including accuracy and cost will be in `your/result/acc/dir` and `your/result/cost/dir`, a summary will be sent to `your@mail.com`.

If you want to add your own models, you'll need to write your models in the `trainers/` directory and register them in dassl, then configure the settings in the `configs/` directory and `configs.py` file. Then you can run `python parallel_runner.py` to run our own model.
